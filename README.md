# Screen Color
A simple page that gives you full screen color. Initial color will be random, but can be customized using the browser's basic `<input type="color">` or by typing in hexcode. If more than one color is added, it will transition between all colors every set second. 

Control panel for choosing color can be closed by clicking anywhere on the screen. The panel can be opened again by hovering and pressing the button on the bottom left of the screen.

Made in, like, an hour, using Svelte, for my friend, Harvi. Feel free to use it for anything, though.

The site is live in [surge](http://screen-color.surge.sh/). You can also run this locally by running 

```
npm run dev
```
